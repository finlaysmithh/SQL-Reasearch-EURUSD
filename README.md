EURUSD NEW WEEK OPENING GAP RESEARCH

Overall Gap-Fill Rate
Filled vs. Unfilled:
Out of about 166 gap events, roughly 126 eventually get filled. This translates to an overall fill rate of about 76%, with the remaining 24% of gaps left unfilled.
Timing of Gap Fills
Week 1 Fills:
A large majority of the filled gaps are resolved in the first week after they occur. Rough estimates suggest that around 65% of all gap events are filled during week 1. This indicates that when gaps are corrected, the market tends to do so very promptly.
Week 2–Week 4 Fills:
The remaining filled gaps are addressed in subsequent weeks. Approximately 10–15% of the gaps find a fill in week 2, and only a small fraction (perhaps around 5–10% overall) are filled in the third or fourth week. In other words, if a gap isn’t corrected almost immediately, the likelihood of a later fill drops off sharply.

This shows for a bullish week the percentage of times that day of the week was closed above the day before. And for a bearish week the percentage times the next day went lower than the day before.
